# 🤗 Welcome

Thank you for considering contributing to **🧲 Magnet**! Without you, this project wouldn't be possible. We tried
to make this file as short as possible, so you can get started as quickly as possible. If you have any questions,
feel free to open an issue or ask in discussions.

# 🔍 Where to start

Not sure what the first steps are? You can start by going through good first issues, help-wanted issues or even
fixing a typo in the documentation! No contribution is too small.

# 🧵 Code style

We use Angular's [commit message guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/). Please make sure
to follow them when writing commit messages.

We have yet to develop a code style guide. For now, please try to follow the style of the existing code.
Key points:

- Tabs for indentation
- Member variables are prefixed with `m_`
- Functions and files are named in `PascalCase`
- Local variables are named in `camelCase`
- Namespaces and macros are named in `UPPER_CASE`
- `{}` on new lines (with some exceptions)

# 🪁 Requesting a feature

We are always open to new ideas! But first, please ask yourself these questions:

- Is this feature already requested/implemented?
- Does it require the user to learn additional concepts (that are specific to Magnet)?
- Can this feature be implemented on top of existing solutions?
- Does it simplify the developer experience and every-day tasks?
- Does it fit the scope of the project?
- Most importantly: Does it align with **Magnet's mission** and **philosophy**?

If you answered all of these questions with "yes", then feel free to open a feature request!

# 🐛 Reporting a bug

Before opening a new issue, please make sure to search for existing issues (both open and closed) to see if your bug
has already been reported. If it has, you can add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
